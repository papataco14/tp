[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

# Introducing LinkMeIn's GUI
LinkMeIn's [GUI](#glossary) is designed to be **simple** and **intuitive**, with you in mind.
The GUI consists of four main components:

![uiIntro.png](images/ui-intro/uiIntro.png)

| Number | Component            | Description                                              |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Command Box          | Key in your commands here and LinkMeIn will execute them |
| 2      | Message Box          | Displays success or error messages to you                |
| 3      | Company List Panel   | Displays the list of companies that you have added       |
| 4      | Company Detail Panel | Displays the details of a company that you are viewing   |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Useful Tip:**<br>
* To maximise your viewing experience, opt for full-screen mode in LinkMeIn!
</div>

Now that you've been introduced to LinkMeIn's GUI, let's proceed to learn how you can use the CLI to interact with LinkMeIn.

[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

# Introducing LinkMeIn's CLI

LinkMeIn operates through the Command Line Interface (CLI), where you interact with our app by simply **typing commands**. Say goodbye to the days of multitasking between typing and clicking, and say hello to the world of CLI!

Don't let the name intimidate you! Continue reading on to discover how **E**ffortless, **E**asy and **E**fficient CLI is when using LinkMeIn.

<div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/cli-description/CliDescription1.png" alt="CliDescription1" width="650"/>
</div>

The Command Box serves as the gateway for entering command lines. Once you press enter, LinkMeIn processes your input and provides responses through the Message Box. This process of interacting with LinkMeIn through text is exactly how CLI works!
Now, let's move on to learn how to write command lines, and you are ready to try LinkMeIn!

## Command Format
A command line has 4 components, **command word**, **index**, **prefix** and **parameter**.

| Component    | Example  | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command Word | `add`    | Indicates the feature to be executed                                                                                                                                      |
| Index        | `1`, `5` | Indicates the position of the company in the list (e.g., 5th company in the list)                                                                                         |
| Parameter    | `John`   | <br/> Represents the updated value or content. <br/> These values, which are provided by the user, replaces the `UPPER_CASE` placeholders in the command format<br/><br/> |
| Prefix       | `c/`     | Indicates the type of parameter to be edited (e.g., company's name)                                                                                                       |

You can find all the parameters used in LinkMeIn [here](#parameters-description).
To learn more about the prefixes and command words used in LinkMeIn, you can refer to the [Command Summary Section](#command-summary).

Now, let's see how you can use these components to easily write a command!
The following color code will assist you in highlighting each component for better understanding.

<div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/cli-description/CommandFormat1.png" alt="CommandFormat1" width="650"/>
</div>

Let's use the [`add` command](#adding-a-company--add) format as shown below to explain the components.
<div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/cli-description/CommandFormat2.png" alt="CommandFormat2" width="750" />
</div>

The `add` command word is used to initiate the adding of a company into LinkMeIn. <br>

The prefix indicates the parameter type. For example, `c/John` adds "John" as the company name while `n/John` adds "John" as the recruiter's name.
Simply replace the parameters with your specific application details, and you have effectively crafted an `add` command!

But wait! Notice the `[]` around `pr/PRIORITY`? Here's what it means:

| Symbol  | Description      | Example          | Interpretation                                        |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| None    | Compulsory field | `C/COMPANY_NAME` | The company's name is required when adding a company  |
| `[ ]`   | Optional field   | `[pr/PRIORITY]`  | Not a must to indicate priority when adding a company |

Since `PRIORITY` parameter is optional, the following command lines are accepted for the `add` command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Examples:**
- `add c/GovTech r/Software Engineer s/PA n/John Doe d/12-12-2023 e/johnDoe@gmail.com p/98765432 pr/medium`
- `add c/GovTech r/Software Engineer s/PA n/John Doe d/12-12-2023 e/johnDoe@gmail.com p/98765432`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**<br>
* Parameters can be in any order. e.g. If the command specifies `c/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE`, `r/ROLE c/COMPANY_NAME` is also acceptable.
* Parameters and prefixes are case-insensitive. e.g. `c/COMPANY_NAME` is the same as `C/company_name`.
</div>

Notice that the `add` command does not use `INDEX` in its command format. Each feature has a unique command format, but every command line must begin with a command word to specify the desired feature. You can find the command format for each feature in the [Features](#current-features) section or take a **quick tour** to get hands-on experience with LinkMeIn, right below!

> `INDEX` must be a positive integer (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...) and should not exceed the number of companies in the list. It should also be less than the maximum allowed integer (i.e. less than or equal to 2147483647). <br>
>
> Remarks cannot be empty.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
**:exclamation: Warning:**<br>
* When adding remarks, the existing remarks of the company is not cumulative. This means that whenever you type new remarks, your existing remarks will be completely overwritten!
</div>

**Examples:**

**Step 1.** After adding the internship for DSTA into LinkMeIn,
you want to note that this internship requires experience in Java.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Step 2.** To note this down, type `remark 3 re/need Java` and press `Enter`.

![RemarkDemo1.png](images/remark-command/RemarkDemo1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Step 3.** You can view the remarks of the 3rd company as shown below in the Company Detail Panel.

![RemarkDemo2.png](images/remark-command/RemarkDemo2.png)

Here are some other examples of `remark` commands that you can try:
- `remark 4 re/interview went well!`
- `remark 5 re/$800 per month`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Possible Error:**

If you have entered an **empty remark**,
you will see an error message in the Message Box as shown below. Don’t worry, just try again with remarks now!

![RemarkErrMsg.png](images/remark-command/RemarkErrMsg.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Useful Tip:**<br>
* However, if you intend to delete the existing remarks of a company and hence entered an empty remark, you should use the `unremark` command instead.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Deleting Remarks of a Company: `unremark`

_You have previously added some remarks to a company, but the remarks have become outdated and you no longer need them anymore. Use the `unremark` command to quickly delete them._

**Format:** `unremark INDEX`

>`INDEX` must be a positive integer (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...) and should not exceed the number of companies in the list. It should also be less than the maximum allowed integer (i.e. less than or equal to 2147483647).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Useful Tip:**<br>
* To add new remarks, you do **NOT** need to delete the existing remarks using `unremark` command first. Directly use the `remark` command to add your new remarks.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* You can unremark a company that already has no remarks.
LinkMeIn does not check for the existence of remarks.
The same success message will be displayed regardless of whether remarks exist for a company.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Example:**

**Step 1.** If you wish to delete the remarks of DSTA company, which is 3rd in the Company List Panel, type `unremark 3` and press `Enter`.

![UnremarkDemo1.png](images/remark-command/UnremarkDemo1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Step 2.** The remarks of DSTA will be removed as shown below.

![UnremarkDemo2.png](images/remark-command/UnremarkDemo2.png)

**Possible Error:**

If you have entered an [**invalid index**](#5-what-is-an-invalid-index),
you will see an error message in the Message Box as shown below. Don’t worry, just edit your index accordingly and try the command again!

![UnremarkErrMsg.png](images/remark-command/UnremarkErrMsg.png)

[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Editing a Company's Information: `edit`

_You look at the details of the application, and realise that you have made a typo or need to update the progress of application. Use the `edit` command to input the accurate details._

**Format:** `edit INDEX [c/COMPANY_NAME] [n/RECRUITER_NAME] [r/ROLE] [s/APPLICATION_STATUS] [d/DEADLINE] [e/EMAIL] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [pr/PRIORITY]`

>`INDEX` must be a positive integer (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...) and should not exceed the number of companies in the list. It should also be less than the maximum allowed integer (i.e. less than or equal to 2147483647). <br>
>
> At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.

**Examples:**

If you've completed the Quick Tour of LinkMeIn, you've likely edited a few companies. If not, you can refer to the [Quick Tour Section](#3-editing-company-details) for guidance on editing companies.

Here are some more examples of `edit` commands that you can try:

- `edit 3 d/11-09-2025 pr/LOW` <br>
  Edits the deadline and priority of the 3rd company in the displayed list.

- `edit 1 n/Amy Tan e/amytan@gmail.com` <br>
  Edits the recruiter's name and email of the 1st company in the displayed list.

**Possible Error:**

If you have entered an **invalid prefix**, you will see an error message in the Message Box. Don’t worry, just edit your prefixes accordingly and
try the command again! An example of an invalid input and error message is shown below.

### Duplicate Detection

_Seeking an internship but worried about double-applying?
Our duplicate detection swiftly ensures you never submit the same application twice!_

If you attempt to **add** or **edit** an application, you might accidentally create a duplicate entry with the same **company name**, **role**, and **deadline** as an existing company in LinkMeIn. An error message will be displayed in the Message Box, informing you of the **company name**, **role** and **deadline** of that duplicate company.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* LinkMeIn's duplicate check is case-insensitive. e.g. `tiktok` is the same as `TikTok`.
</div>

**Example 1:**
Suppose you attempt to add a company with the **exact same company and recruiter information** as an existing entry in LinkMeIn, you will be notified of the duplicate company, as seen below.

![img.png](images/duplicate-detection/add-command/duplicate-exact-match.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Example 2:**
If you attempt to add a company with the **same company name, role and deadline**, but different recruiter information, you will be see an error message similar to that in Example 1. However, in this case, LinkMeIn will also prompt you to edit the parameter that differs from the duplicate company, recognizing that you may have accidentally used the `add` command instead of the `edit` command.

![img.png](images/duplicate-detection/add-command/duplicate-partial-match.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Example 3:**
LinkMeIn's duplicate check does not stop with adding entries. If you attempt to **edit** an application, creating a
duplicate entry with the **same company name, role, and deadline** as an existing application in LinkMeIn,
an error message will be displayed in the Message Box, notifying you of the duplicate company as seen below.

![img.png](images/duplicate-detection/edit-command/duplicate-edit.png)

## Company List Features
These features are crafted to simplify the management of your list of companies in LinkMeIn! Continue reading to discover more about how they work!

### Finding a Company: `find`

_You've applied to many companies, and now you wish to monitor your internship applications for a specific company. Use the find command for a swift and efficient way to locate the company you want!_

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`
> KEYWORD must be at least 1 character long. Multiple keywords can be provided.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**<br>
* The `find` command searches only the company name.
* Companies with names that contain **any** of the keywords will be returned.
* Keyword is case-insensitive (e.g. `tiktok` will match `TikTok`).
* The order of your keywords doesn't matter (e.g. `tiktok google` will match `google tiktok`).
* LinkMeIn's `find` command will always find from the **full** list of companies. This means that if you have previously used `filter`, performing `find`, will not search from the filtered list of companies.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Useful Tip:**<br>
* You don't have to type the full name of the company. Partial names work too! For example, `tik` will match 
`tiktok`. Use this to find companies quickly!
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Example:**

**Step 1:** Let's say you want to follow up on a DSTA application. Simply type `find ds` to search for DSTA.

![img.png](images/find-command/BeforeFind.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Step 2:** You will see the list of companies that match your search criteria. In this case, the company DSTA will be
shown. And that is it! You have found the company you wanted.

![img.png](images/find-command/AfterFind.png)

[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Listing All Companies: `list`

_You've found the specific company you wanted using the find command earlier, and now you want to see all of your applications in one list again. You can do so easily with the `list` command!_

**Format:** `list`

**Example:**

**Step 1:** You have used the `find` command to find the company _DSTA_ earlier. Now, to view the full list of companies again, simply type `list` and press `Enter`!

![img.png](images/list-command/ListCommand.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Upon launching LinkMeIn, you will see your full list of companies. (i.e. `list` command is executed automatically).
</div>

[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Filtering Companies by Application Status: `filter`

_Can't remember which applications you haven't submitted or want to prepare for the companies that have offered you an interview?
Filter the list of companies by their application status using the `filter` command!_

**Format:** `filter s/APPLICATION_STATUS`

> [**APPLICATION_STATUS**](#application-status-parameter-description) should be one of the following: `PA`, `PI`, `PO`, `A`, `R`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* LinkMeIn's `filter` command will always filter from the **full** list of companies. This means that if you have previously used `find`, performing `filter`, will not filter from the list of companies that you have searched for.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Example:**

**Step 1:** You wish to prepare for the upcoming interviews that you have secured.

**Step 2:** Simply type `filter s/PI` to filter the list of companies to show only companies with status "Pending Interview" and press `Enter`.

![img.png](images/filter-command/FilterByPI.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Step 3:** You can then check the Company List Panel for all the companies where you have pending interviews.

![img.png](images/filter-command/AfterFilterCommand.png)

**Possible Error:**

If you enter an invalid prefix for the filter command, you will see an error message informing you of the invalid command, and suggest the correct format to follow.

![img.png](images/filter-command/FilterCommandError.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Sorting Companies by Deadlines: `sort`

_Want to see which application deadlines are coming up soon or which ones are far off? Use the `sort` command to
arrange your list of applications based on their deadlines!_

**Format:** `sort SORT_ORDER`
> SORT_ORDER should be one of the following: `ascending`, `a`, `asc` for ascending order, and `descending`, `d`, `desc` for descending order.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**<br>
* Ascending order means that the nearest deadlines will be shown first.
* Descending order means that the furthest deadlines will be shown first.
* The case of `SORT_ORDER` does not matter (e.g. `ASCENDING` and `ascending` are treated the same).
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Useful Tip:**<br>
* If no `SORT_ORDER` is specified, it will be set to `ascending` by default. Use this to quickly see which deadlines are 
coming up soon by simply typing `sort`!
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Example:**

**Step 1.** You've lost track of time and are uncertain about which internship deadlines are looming. Your current
list looks chaotic. Just type `sort ascending` to sort the list of applications by their deadlines.

![typecommand.png](images/sort-command/BeforeSorting.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

**Step 2.** Your applications are now organized by upcoming deadlines. Time to start applying without delay!

![img.png](images/sort-command/AfterSorting.png)

**Possible Error:**

Suppose you misspelled the `SORT-ORDER` keyword, you will see an error message informing you of the invalid keyword,
and suggest the correct keyword to use:

| **Prefix**           | Prefix is a keyword that is used to identify the parameter. For example, in the command `edit 1 c/COMPANY_NAME e/EMAIL`, `c/` and `e/` are prefixes.                                                                                |
